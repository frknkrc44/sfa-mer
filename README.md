Sailfish/Mer image build scripts
--------------------------------

The set of scripts aims to help preparing Sailfish/Mer images for the Nexus 5 pocket computer in a clean, easy and reprodicible way. They have been largely written by following [the guide](http://releases.sailfishos.org/sfa-ea/2014-07-21_SailfishOSHardwareAdaptationDevelopmentKit.pdf), [the wiki](https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Building_Sailfish_OS_for_Nexus_5) and advice from alin, sledges, vgrade and others in #sailfishos-porters at irc.freenode.org.

## Instructions

  - Read the scripts starting from fullbuild.sh and try to understand what goes on and why! Description of the accepted options is printed by `fullbuild.sh -h`.

  - Backup ~/.hadk.env, ~/.mersdk.profile and ~/.mersdkubu.profile if you want to keep them. They will be overwriten!

  - Make sure the .sh files are executable and start the 'fullbuild.sh' script. After a shortwhile it will ask for the root password to enter the Mer chroot.

  - If all goes successfull, after an hour or so, a freshly baked image should be found in the current working directory.

  - The scripts below fullbuild.sh, responsible for the different activities, can be executed in standalone mode after initial fullbuild.sh, to repeat certain parts of the build. Of these, ahal.sh, build-img.sh and the combined hal-mw-and-img.sh are probably most useful. Each script contains a short description in its heading.


## Notes

  - If you have ~/.scratchbox2 it will be autobacked up to ~/.scratchbox2-$(date +%d-%m-%Y.%H-%M-%S).

  - After a successfull build the different scripts can be used manually independently to update certain parts of the build. However they are not documented yet.

  - Repeated execution of the script is intended to only update the sources and rebuild the differences, the middleware and the image.

  - Before running the script ensure git is installed on the host, and your details are setup
    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "Add your e-mailadress here instead"
    git config --global user.name "Add your full name here instead"
    ```

  - If building hybris-hal in parallel mode fails, try "-jobs 1" (see example below).

## **WARNING**

  **CLOSE THE UNHINDERED ROOT ACCESS AT PORT 2323 BEFORE CONNECTING TO THE NET**

## Usage example
```bash
last alpha5 for hammerhead
./fullbuild.sh -mer-root /home/alin/lavello/NEXUS5/mer-jan-t2 -android-root /home/alin/lavello/NEXUS5/ubu-jan-t2 -branch hybris-11.0 -device hammerhead -vendor lge -dest /home/alin/lavello/nexus5 -sfrelease 1.1.1.27  -extraname alpha5 -jobs 4 -dhdrepo "http://repo.merproject.org/obs/nemo:/devel:/hw:/lge:/hammerhead/sailfish_latest_armv7hl/" -mwrepo "http://repo.merproject.org/obs/nemo:/devel:/hw:/lge:/hammerhead/sailfish_latest_armv7hl/" -extrarepo x -target update10
```
## alternatif :)
```./fullbuild.sh -mer-root /home/anka/sfa-mer-master/d802 -android-root /home/anka/sfa-mer-master/d802 -branch hybris-12.1 -device /home/anka/sfa-mer-master/d802 -vendor lge -dest /home/anka/sfa-mer-master/d802 -sfrelease 1.1.1.27  -extraname alpha5 -jobs 4 -dhdrepo "http://repo.merproject.org/obs/nemo:/devel:/hw:/lge:/hammerhead/sailfish_latest_armv7hl/" -mwrepo "http://repo.merproject.org/obs/nemo:/devel:/hw:/lge:/hammerhead/sailfish_latest_armv7hl/" -extrarepo x -target update10
```

Change the whole above command line for your user directory and the model and maker that you're building for.
